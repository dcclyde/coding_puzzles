to add:
passed in a bool --> something about bit reference?
__LINE__ automatically

I think debug should also accept a char* (sometimes "") as a label.


set up my codeforces directory as a git(hub) repo.

debug() should output a=a, b=b, c=c instead of a, b, c = a, b, c.
debug() should output line number and also a comment/label.


before adding to git, throw out any files that still perfectly match the template.
*** or should I throw out any files with modified time within 1 minute of parent folder?

Make "+" mean vector concatenation.





replace cd with pushd-ish

make tab = 4 spaces in debug template.

Mess with crcf so it compiles faster while still catching some interesting mistakes.
