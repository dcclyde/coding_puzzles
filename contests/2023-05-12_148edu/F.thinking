N <= 2000
T, G <= 1e9

N entrances, K generators, T duration, G generator duration

They give me pairs like (L, R).
I have to choose generator positions so that everyone can hook up to a generator
    and the total overlap is big.

*****

Sort the guarded intervals.

Maybe DP where I only consider placing generators to match start or end of a given interval.

f(position, num generators still available)
