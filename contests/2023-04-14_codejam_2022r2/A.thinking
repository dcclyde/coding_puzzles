Clearly I need N-1 <= K <= N^2-1.
Parity also needs to match.

Goal:
Go straight until square S, then run directly to the middle.
Seems like I could just binary search for when I should break off.
Remaining steps:

F(n) = row, column where n appears
G(r, c) = number written in position (r, c).


*****

How far should I walk before moving toward the middle?
Each "outward" step adds 2 to my min achievable distance.
