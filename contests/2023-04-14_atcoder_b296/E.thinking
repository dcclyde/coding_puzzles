First, Sequence is given

A chooses integer K_i

B chooses integer S_i from 1..N


We play N times.
In round r, I want to end up with r on the blackboard.
How many rounds can I win?

OK, so I need to identify cycles and how far each person is from a cycle.
I'm given N directed edges from x to dat[x].

Actually - the question is just asking how many positions are in cycles?
