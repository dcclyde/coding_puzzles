It should always be possible as long as the total number of 1s is divisible.

Split rows into light vs heavy.

For each column, check which light rows are 0 here and which heavy rows are 1 here.
Match em up and record these operations.
Remember to update the weight of each row, since light/heavy rows can become neutral.

***************

I need to record:
light stuff: row id --> weight
heavy stuff: row_id --> weight
