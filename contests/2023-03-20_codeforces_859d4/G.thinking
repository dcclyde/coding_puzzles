N up to 2e5.
Elements also up to 2e5...??

Array starts with just 1.

Sort C.
I want to know whether every element can be written as a sum of
    some of the preceding elements.

Can I maintain a data structure of all reachable stuff?
Seems like no way.
The first 30 items could just be like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
Well, the elements are only up to 2e5 though....

Could I do some IntervalUnion type stuff?
Not clear how many distinct intervals we could have.
