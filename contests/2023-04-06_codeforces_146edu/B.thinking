Target dims up to 1e9.

Path cost is num steps + biggest step size.

Go to 10:
5 + 5 costs 7

Go to 100:
50 + 50 costs 52
10s costs 11

If I use max step B then cost will be B + ceil(X / B) + ceil(Y / B).

Can I assume final cost will be a divisor of X or Y?
Probably not... what if X was some big prime?

B + ceil(X/B) + ceil(Y/B)

What if B increases by 1?


I guess just try all B, since it'll be more or less bounded by sqrt(X+Y).

Target square 3?
