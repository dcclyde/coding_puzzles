N <= 1e18.

Need longest interval length such that L, L+1, L+2, ... are all divisors of N.

*****

They don't assume I know how to factor.
Maybe the intervals should just be pretty small?

*****

OK that did get accepted.
Can I prove something about why?
Maybe I can say something about lcm of an interval?

LCM of 1...(R-L) should be smaller than lcm of L..R?
