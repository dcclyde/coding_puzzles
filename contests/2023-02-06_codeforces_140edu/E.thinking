This smells like some standard graph theory thing to me.
I basically can't allow any consecutive unavailable platforms.
So the data amounts to a long list like:
    we need at least one of (j, k)

N doesn't matter at all.
We have a graph with 40 vertices and at most 780 edges.

Pick some vertices such that our set touches every edge.

Conversely, pick vertices to *exclude* such that we don't cover any edges.
