Given a tree. N <= 2e5.
Choose which edges to remove so that all remaining CCs have 3 nodes.
(or report it's impossible)

*****

Start at deepest leaf.
Grab v, parent[v].
If parent[v] has no other children, grab parent[parent[v]].
If parent[v] has 1 other child, grab that.
Otherwise lose.

Initial traversal:
    parent of each node
    children of each node - probably a hash table so I can delete/lookup fast.
    depth of each node
