Everything needs to appear even number of times, EXCEPT the largest value.
I need seq of N elements summing to S.

Elements need to be >= 1.
S <= 1e9.

*****

If the number of elements is even then the sum should be even.
If N odd then S could be "whatever".
Always need S >= N though.

Choose all 1s then something huge?
If N is even then split the huge thing in half?
