I need an N x N matrix with entries in 0..N-1.

They force specific values along the diagonal.

N is prime and N < 350.
    I could run N^3 if I want.

Requirement: For any rectangle [[a, b], [c, d]] in the grid, a+d-b-c mod N can't be 0.

Well...
Say I know x[0][0] and x[0][1].
Then I would know

.
