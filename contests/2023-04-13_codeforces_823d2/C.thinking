Given 1..N.
Given some subset T.

I want the cheapest cost to delete all elements in U.
Deleting an element x costs...?

We pick d dividing x.

I think just delete elements in U from low to high.
For each element x, I need to know the smallest d | x
    such that no previous multiples of d are in U.
