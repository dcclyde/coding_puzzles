Need shortest distance (a, b)
such that a, b in [L, R] and dat[a] == dat[b].

shortest distance could be a min query?
How do I handle the "dat[a] == dat[b]" part?


!!!!!

Sort queries by increasing L.
Maintain a segtree:
seg[k] = distance to nearest equal neighbor on the left,
    or INF if there is no matching neighbor to the left.
    Neighbors < current L don't count.
