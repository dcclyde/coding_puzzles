Working on a tree.

update(c): "attack city c at time Y"

query(a, b): kth item on the path from a to b,
not counting stuff that was attacked after year Y.

    Tree aspect: Seems like binary search in a HLD that holds a segtree.

    At Y=0, all nodes hold value 1.
    Attack a city: Set it to 0.
    Query:
        Binary search through year Y version vs current version.
        Find first node where current query [a, x] is >= K + year y query [a, x].


This looks hard to implement!
