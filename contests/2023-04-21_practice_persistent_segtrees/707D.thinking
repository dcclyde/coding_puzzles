Operations:

0. Query total book count.
1. Assign shelf[R, C] = 1
2. Assign shelf[R, C] = 0
3. Flip all bits on shelf R.
4. Jump back to a historical position.

~ Using PSeg:

0: Query sum
1: Assign a position
2: Assign a position
3: Flip a range
4: Revert

Seems like normal PSeg stuff.
A little extra work due to the 2 operations though.
At least they give 512 MB.
