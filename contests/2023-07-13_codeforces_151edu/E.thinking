N boxes, K moves.
Given some starting setup.
I make K moves, each moving a single ball to left or right.
How many different arrangements could I find at the end?

*****

This could be DP?

state:
    What box number are we looking at?
    What's the most recent ball we used?
    How many moves have we made?


There will be some parity considerations.
