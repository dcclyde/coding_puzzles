Given list of rating changes.
N <= 3e5.

I get to pick a floor F. Rating can never fall below F.
What F will give the biggest possible final rating?

Rating changes have abs value <= 1e9.

*****

Given some walk shape.
I can use the biggest possible upward chunk at the end.

Maybe something like: Find the biggest possible downward chunk?
