X is written.
Operation: Write X+1.
How long will it take before I've seen all digits base P?

N <= 100
P <= 1e9.

***

If p is big, I definitely will need to make most of a loop in 1s place.

I could handle p


What's the last digit I'll need to create in 1s place?


I guess:
For each A[k], and each A[k]+1, I can directly compute the first time it'll show up.
Other values will all just show up in the 1s place.
