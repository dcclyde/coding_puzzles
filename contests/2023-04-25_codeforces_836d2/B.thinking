Given N.
I need xor of my array to equal average value.

If N is odd, I can just choose all 1s, right?

N even...
a copies of x, b copies of y
a, b odd
xor is x^y
average is (a*x + b*y) / (a+b)

I need xor to be in between x and y.
I could try x = 1, y = 3?
No, then I'd need a = b = N/2.

x = 1, y = 2k+1

xor is 2k
I need N * 2k == a + (N-a) * (2k+1)
a = N / (2k)
I need a to be odd. I should just pick k = 2 ^ (max pow2 dividing N, minus 1)
