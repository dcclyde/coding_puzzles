Need a permutation
P[N] = 1
P[1] = x
P[2] is a multiple of 2
P[3] is a multiple of 3
etc...

I guess basically I need a path that starts at x, moves to multiples, ends at N.
What does "lex smaller" mean?
Better to take smallest possible first(...) step.

OK, so find prime factorization of N/x and use that.
