Track the first position with a 1.
Track the last position with a 0.

some special case if one or both doesn't exist.
    (a chunk of all 0s is the same as a chunk of all 1s)

    Actually wait. Just - if the chunk is already sorted then use one general marker score.

Just store those pairs in a hash table

.
