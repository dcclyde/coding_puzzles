I need to do H damage total.

I could do A damage every tA steps and B every tB steps.
Or, I could do C damage if both cannons are ready.

What strategies should I be considering?
Use A and B, but if they're "near synced" then wait instead?


I guess:
Suppose A is ready to shoot.
Given H and current cooldown on B, should I wait or just shoot now?
