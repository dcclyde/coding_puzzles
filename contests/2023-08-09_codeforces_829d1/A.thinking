N <= 2e5
A[k] = -1, 0, 1

I need to break into chunks.
Compute alternating sum of each chunk.
Those sums should add up to 0.

*****

I might as well make all chunks of size 1 or 2.
Let's say sumv(A) = S.
I want to flip S/2 1s to -1s.

*****

For the large case, I can add 1s but also 2s?
No, I actually just don't see any differences that matter.
Yeah, same code works.
