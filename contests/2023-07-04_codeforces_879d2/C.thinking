A changes 1 character at every step.
B reverses a string at every step.

A wants the game to end fast.
B wants the game to take forever.

N <= 1e5

***************

Reversing doesn't change the situation in any confusing way.
It's just a parity thing.

A basically wants to make X == Y *or* X == rev(Y).
Then track parity to see if it takes 1 extra turn to finish.
