Score for intervals A, B is 2 * (length that's in the bigger but not smaller).

*****

Probably I want to sort the intervals somehow?
Say [l, r] is the big interval.
I want smallest possible length of some other interval's overlap with [l, r].
    Other interval is to the right: Need left endpoint as big as possible.
    Other interval is to the left: Need right endpoint as small as possible.
    Other interval is contained: Need len as small as possible.
