N <= 2e5.

For each k, I want smallest value difference, but with a penalty for how far I walk.

Maybe think about
Q[j] = P[j] + j
R[j] = P[j] - j

I'd like to "query only the positions with P[j] < P[k]".


If walking to the left, I basically just pay



Some kinda segtree where I run a query at time j and the future data isn't there yet?


Among items on the right with bigger P, what's min of P[j] + j?
