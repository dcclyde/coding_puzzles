Up to 200k songs total.

I basically need to shuffle blocks (albums) around
so that the longest increasing subsequence will be very long.

I can assume each album is increasing.

I could imagine some DP like
F[n] = best score ending at value <= n

then process albums in order by biggest entry.

F[n] = max over...
    If current album is [5, 10, 12]
    F[12..infinity] can be F[11] + 1
        or F[9] + 2
        or F[4] + 3
