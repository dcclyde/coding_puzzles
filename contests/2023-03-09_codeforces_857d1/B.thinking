Can I iterate over the most expensive gift I'll buy for person 1?

Say I'll buy the most expensive one ever for A.
B could use or discard any gift except the one we gave A.

Now say A uses the 2nd-most-expensive gift.
B MUST use the one opposite A's most expensive.
B CAN'T use the one opposite what we're currently using.
B MAY use any others.
