Given x <= 1e9.

I need to find c such that (x+c) ^ (x-c) = x.

Say x = 1011.
x+c and x-c are different in 0-bit.
OK, it can only work if x is even?

Their examples that work:
2       10
10      1010
18      10010
36      100100

Their examples that don't work:
6       110
5       101


8       1000
6, 10?  0110, 1010

x+c had better not reach the next power of 2.

2       10      1,3     01, 11

8       1000
        1100, 0100

.
