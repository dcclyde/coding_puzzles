Each wrong position needs to be able to reach the far edge.

1   2   3   4   5   6

1   5   3   4   2   6

1 2 3 4 5 6

1 5 3 4 2 6
1 6 3 4 2 5

! oh wait - we can only make swaps at distance EXACTLY k.

Suppose I have

1 . . 1 . 1 . . .
. 1 . . 1 . . . 1

what k values will work?


! Oh wait x2 - it's a permutation, so each value occurs only once.
