N, E <= 2e5
edges are colored red or blue.

vertices are also colored.

~ Sounds like it's possible to have both color edges between same pair of vertices.

I need to find a spanning tree where a red vertex always touches at least one red edge
    and same for blue.

*****

It means I need to find N-1 edges that satisfy this condition everywhere.
