Given an array A and a binary string S.

1 l r: flip everything in S[l, r].
2 g:
    g is a bit.
    return xor of everything in A that corresponds to a value of S[i] = g.

*****

Easy to compute xors of whole intervals.
Then I just need xor of the 1 items.

"xor of 1 items" could be a segtree operation...
could I update that segtree fast enough?
Seems like it should be doable...??
