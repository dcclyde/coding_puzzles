Probably I want to build some cycle structure?

I have 12 buckets:
    slots that have 1, need 2
    have 1, need 3
    have 1, need 4
    have 2, need 1
    etc

I guess I basically score 1 point for every cycle I build.


3 4 1 1 2 4
1 1 2 3 4 4

1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1
4 1


1 2 3
2 3 4
2 3 4
1 3 4


1 2
