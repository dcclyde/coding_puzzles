N <= 1e6.

Need a string that can't be turned into ANY bad grid.

*****

~ Can't have adjacent repeats.

If the string is bad, that means there's some d | N
and position k
where S[k] == S[k+d].

Maybe this is a graph?
Each divisor makes a bunch of edges.
Then I need to color the graph so that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

num divisors <= 240.
