Operation:
Increase x by 1 if it's <= the NEXT element (wrapping at end)

Test whether I can eventually make A into B.

N <= 2e5
values up to 1e9

*****

How big can A[k] get?

Start at any instance of argmin B[k].
(Maybe just rearrange the arrays so that's at the end.)
Then walk backward checking whether I can create each A[k].
Options:
    Keep the starting value (works if A[k] == B[k]).
    Take any value up to A[k+1] + 1.
