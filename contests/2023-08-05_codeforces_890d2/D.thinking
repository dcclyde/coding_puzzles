Pay (R-L)^2, receive num inversions in [L, R].

Note we don't pay (num elements)^2. We pay (num elements - 1)^2.
That makes me lean a little more toward querying small intervals.

"If we could check [1, 2] then [1, 3] then [1, 4] then etc, we'd win."
That costs too much though: O(N^3).

Check all pairs --> know max element of each pair --> eliminate half the candidates.

First round:
    Compare "all pairs".
