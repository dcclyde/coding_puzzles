Check best score for each slot one by one? Maybe back to front?

How do I compute the best score in slot k?

For each possible start position, we ask:
* Where will this hill end?
    Maybe binary search? Try to achieve height H?
        What's the first position to the right of k,
            such that the A[k] + H runs into that bar?
