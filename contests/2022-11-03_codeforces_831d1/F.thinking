maybe store as v[k] = position of kth object?

f(board, sofar, biggest_allowed)


If I have [2000] (i.e. 2000 items appearing once each)
then I don't want to store it as


Maybe I should store state like:
(num 1s, num 2s, num 3s, ..., num Bs) plus (list of indices for bigger stuff).

Smaller stuff costs B.
Larger stuff costs <= MAX/B.
so I guess I'd want B ~ sqrt(MAX) ~ 45.


Looking up whether I've already seen a certain state costs B time though?
