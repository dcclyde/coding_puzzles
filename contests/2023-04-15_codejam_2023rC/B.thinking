Sounds like segment tree stuff?

First compress everything?
Probably I also want to make different versions of a coordinate that has 2 different items.

I need these queries:
* In the std::set of vaccine positions, which are in range [L, R]?
    (pick these up and remove from the set.)
    to "pick it up", we insert the corresponding




.
