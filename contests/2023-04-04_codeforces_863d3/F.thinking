How many vertices does a K-flower have?
K^2 I guess.

How many edges?
K+1 loops, each with K edges.

* Graph should be connected.
* Everyone should have degree 2 or 4.
* If I start somewhere with degree 4 and traverse only deg 4,
    I should end up where I started after K steps with no other options.
* If I start somewhere deg 2 and traverse only deg 2, I should find 2 endpoints K-1 apart.
