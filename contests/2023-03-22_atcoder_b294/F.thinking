I should set up my binary search such that I can sort array B once
    and binary search through it each time.

Fix a target concentration C.
I have a bunch of (salt, total) pairs like (s, t).
Given a/b from first array, what does (s, t) need to satisfy?

I need (a+s) / (b+t) >= C
a+s >= Cb + Ct
a - Cb >= Ct - s

So, I should just sort the second array by Ct-s.
