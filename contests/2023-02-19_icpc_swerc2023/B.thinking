N <= 300

Cubic should be OK.

Each brick should staircase directly R or L.
So there are only 2^N strategies we could ever consider.




.

Let's say goal blocks at height 0 and then build upward.
We need the final block at height H.

f(j, h) = cost to handle first i blocks and have a block at (x_j, h).
exists (x_i, j) for j in 0,h




DP left to right.  Cost to add a block at hight h under the ith goal block.




---

g(l, r) = position where [l, r) could be united?
    need to know the height cost but also the horizontal position.

Update:
    Break [l, r) into 2 chunks: [l, m) and [m, r)
    Use subanswers for the chunks and decide where we could unite those two endpoints.
    Pick the best result?

For a given interval, there should be only one plausible "unite point".
(The outside edges should always run directly to each other).

! Careful: I think there's some parity issue.
If the distance between endpoints is odd, then there'll be 2 options
    for where to place the bottom.
    Keep track of which intervals had this situation.
    Then when we use those as subproblems, we should just make sure we choose
    the rightmost base for the first (left) subinterval
    and leftmost base for the 2nd (right) subinterval.
