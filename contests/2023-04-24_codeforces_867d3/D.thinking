N <= 2e5.

I choose a permutation of length N.
I need all prefix sums to be different mod N.

I guess N has to come first.

Example answers use prefix sum ordering like 0,  -1, 1,  -2, 2, ...
                                             N, N-1, 2, N-3, 4, ...


Alternate formulation: There shouldn't be any range in [1, N-1] that sums to 0 mod N.


Try putting N, -1.
"sub-prefixes" can't be 1.
