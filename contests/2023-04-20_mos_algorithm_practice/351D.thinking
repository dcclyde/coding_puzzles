The query is:
How many evenly-spaced constant subseqs will we need to remove to get empty seq?

Wait no, I get to permute after each operation.
If some number has all occurrences in an arithmetic subseq, answer = num distinct.
Otherwise, answer = num distinct + 1.

I guess for each value I should track:
    How many copies are there?
    If there are >= 2 copies, are they evenly spaced? If so, what's the layout?
