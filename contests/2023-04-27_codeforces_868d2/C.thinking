"strongly composite": num prime divisors <= num composite divisors.
    1 is neither.

Given array A.
I need to find array B:
B has same product as A, and all items in B are strongly composite.
B as big as possible.

pqr:
p q r
pq qr pq pqr

pq^2
p q
pq q^2



p^2 is good
    p
    p^2


pq
    p q
    pq


OK, so I guess:
pair everything up until we have
