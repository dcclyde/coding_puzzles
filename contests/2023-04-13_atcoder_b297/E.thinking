In AtCoder Kingdom,
N kinds of takoyakis (ball-shaped Japanese food) are sold. A takoyaki of the
i-th kind is sold for
A
i
â€‹
  yen.

Takahashi will buy at least one takoyaki in total. He is allowed to buy multiple takoyakis of the same kind.

Find the
K-th lowest price that Takahashi may pay. Here, if there are multiple sets of takoyakis that cost the same price, the price is counted only once.

!!!!!!

N <= 10
K <= 2e5

Seems binsearchy?

Or...
Actually, maybe I can use a priority_queue and just insert new items each time I pop one off.
