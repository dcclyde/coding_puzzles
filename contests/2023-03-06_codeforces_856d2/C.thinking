"score" = product of d terms / d!
"cost" = max length that can tie for best score

1 2 3:
    1: best score is 1, best length is 1

    1 2 3: best score is 3/1 *or* 2*3 / 2


To get the best score: Take the biggest element, then keep adding element from back
    and divisors from front until they pass each other.

I need the largest k such that dat[N-1-k] >= k.
