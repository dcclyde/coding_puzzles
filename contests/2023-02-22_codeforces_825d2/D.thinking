"N" <= 2e5.

Rotate some subseq to the RIGHT.
Then I need to partition into two matching subseqs.

-----

To partition:
Maintain a queue of stuff that's in the first subseq but not the 2nd.

OK, I guess the todo list will only have one type of digit at a time.

1 0 0 0 0 0

First guy takes a 1
Now first guy needs to take all 0s until the next 1.
