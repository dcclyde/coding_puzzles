Each vertex has some subtree(s) that no other special vertex sees.
If one of those is big enough, done.
Otherwise, we have some number of specials trying to share a region.

ok so at each vertex I need to store:
    how many more steps are needed from here?

    visited?


then also use a priority queue to decide what to work on next.
