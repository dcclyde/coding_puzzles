C % 4 is 0.

Each floor is half doubles and half singles.

What's the min and max number of apartments with at least one lit window?

*******

Score = num_1s - num_double_1s.
Min: I should make lots of double 1s.
    I like 00 and 11 doubles.

Max: I should avoid lots of double 1s.
    I like 01 doubles.

Watch out: if I greedily fill in the doubles I like, it's probably possible
    that I'll fill more than half the space?
