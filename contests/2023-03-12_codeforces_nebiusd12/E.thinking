N <= 20.

Seems like I could juuuuust about try everything....

How can I characterize good/bad assignments?

Starting from v, I can follow the path a^n(v).
This path needs to eventually neighbor every vertex.

Any chance I literally just need a cycle that borders everybody?
There's definitely at least a path that borders everyone.
What happens if it's not a cycle?

What happens when p[2] follows the path?
Need to eventually border p[0].
