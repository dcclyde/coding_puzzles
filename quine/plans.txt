dat = '''stuff here'''

out = ''
for c in dat:
    if c == '@':
        out += '''other stuff'''
    else:
        out += c

print(out)

--------------------------------------

What do my placeholders need to look like for this to work?
If I take `dat` and replace `@` with `other_stuff` then I should recover the whole program.

I guess the key question is how to replicate the contents of `dat`.


Escape codes I'll want:
@       time to reproduce the whole "dat = ..." line.
$       '''


.
