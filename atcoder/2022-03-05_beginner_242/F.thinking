I want num ways to put B rooks into R x C grid while "fully using the grid".
Feels like DP.

F = ways fully using the grid
G = ways total

G( R , C , B ) = bin( R*C , B )

If I know all the Fs for c, what can I say about c+1?

F(R, c, b) * G(R-c', c+c', b') gets added onto F(R,

F(r, c, b) * G(


.
