If next_sword > nt:
    Jump to nt
    update next_sword
    update available
    continue

OK, make the next sword.

Now fast forward until nt.
    Make as many swords as we can.

Update next_sword: It could be right after the previous, or it could use new guy.
    Not if this event is removing a guy though!
