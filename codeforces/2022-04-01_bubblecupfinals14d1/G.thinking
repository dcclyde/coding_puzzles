Think about the situation when we arrive at the non-colinear point.
From here, we'll go to nearest endpoint of remaining points, then other endpoint.
If both original endpoints remain, our work so far has been useless.
    For this case: Try walking directly from start to NCP.

otherwise go to at least one original endpoint, then NCP, then finish.
